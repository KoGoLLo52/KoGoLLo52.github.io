            <p class="Text">A few years ago I started this project,just a simple discord bot that could reproduce music,
                check if someone is live in twitch, see your current rank in lol and some other silly things that I have
                made throught the time.

            <p class="Text">This project was one of my first ones; it is actually quite simple. Lists, bitmaps, one
                picture box, and some small things are pretty much all the elements that I used to create this "snake."
                Someday, I'll make a better version of this

            <p class="Text">At the same time that I started with the discord bot, I also tried to work on a Twitch bot.
                This bot has the capability to save text commands, but its functionality is still a work in progress.
                Currently, it only has the osu command and sometimes doesn't work properly.

            <p class="Text"> This may be the simplest one, as it is just a user interface (UI). The UI is designed to
                assist users with yt-dlp, as I found the video downloader tool to be difficult to use with console
                commands. Using commands in the console can be uncomfortable for some, so this UI allows users to easily
                utilize the tool.
